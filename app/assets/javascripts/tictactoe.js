  // Attaches the appropriate event listeners to the squares of the game board as well as for the`button#save`, `button#previous`, and`button#clear` elements.
  // When a user clicks on a square on the game board, the event listener should invoke`doTurn()` and pass it the element that was clicked.
  // *** NOTE ***: `attachListeners()` _must_ be invoked inside either a`$(document).ready()`(jQuery) or a`window.onload = () => {}`(vanilla JavaScript).Otherwise, a number of the tests will fail(not to mention that your game probably won't function in the browser).
  // When you name your save and previous functions, make sure to call them something like`saveGame()` and`previousGames()`.If you call them`save()` and`previous()` you may run into problems with the test suite.
